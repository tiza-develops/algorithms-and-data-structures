# Hello! Welcome to my theoretical repo.

I tend to like things tidy in my github, so I keep this as a monolithical repo where I will keep:
- My answers to the exercises of [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-54256-6) book on a markdown format.
- My solutions on different programming languages of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems.
- My C implementations of algorithms and data structures of Leet Code.

This is **not**, however a reference on those things. Perhaps later I will do that!
