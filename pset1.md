# Exercises: Chapter 1
1. Show that $a+b$ can be less than $\min(a,b)$.
    Assume that both $a,b<0$ so $a+b < a,b$ and also $a+b<\min(a,b)$.$\qed$

2. Show that $a\times b$ can be less than $\min(a,b)$.
    Assume that exactly one of $a,b$ is negative. Then $|a\times b|<0$ but also $|a\times b| > |a,b|$. So then $|a\times b| > \min(a,b)$. $\qed$
